# Ship Fuel Consumption & CO₂ Emissions Analysis

This project analyzes ship fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions based on operational data, using machine learning models to uncover insights and predict emissions.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- Ship ID, Ship Type
- Route and Month
- Distance Traveled
- Fuel Type and Fuel Consumption
- CO₂ Emissions
- Weather Conditions
- Engine Efficiency

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Explore relationships between fuel usage and emissions
- Understand the impact of distance, engine efficiency, and weather
- Predict CO₂ emissions using regression models

## 🧠 Model Insights

- Multiple regression models were trained and evaluated.
- R² scores, feature importances, and error metrics were used for comparison.
